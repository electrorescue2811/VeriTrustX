# VeriTrustX

> QR-Verified Digital Governance System  
> Developed by Team E-ResQ

VeriTrustX is a secure, scalable, and real-time digital identity verification system designed for NGOs and social impact organizations.  
It eliminates identity fraud and replaces manual verification processes with encrypted QR-based authentication.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

NGOs often rely on:

- Physical ID cards
- Paper-based appointment letters
- Manual identity verification
- Non-standardized documentation

These systems are vulnerable to forgery, identity fraud, and operational delays.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

VeriTrustX introduces a QR-based Digital Identity Framework that provides:

- Unique Digital Identity (UUID-based)
- Encrypted QR Code Generation
- Real-time Verification Engine
- Secure Cloud-Based Database
- Mobile Digital Identity Wallet

The system enables instant identity authentication through QR scanning.

- Mobile Application (Digital Identity Wallet)
- Web-based Admin Dashboard

### Backend
- RESTful API Services
- Authentication & Authorization Server
- QR Generation & Verification Engine

### Database
- Secure Cloud Storage
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. Admin registers NGO staff
2. System generates a Unique UUID
3. Encrypted QR code is created
4. QR is embedded in:
   - Digital ID Card
   - Appointment Letter
   - Membership Certificate
5. On scan:
   - QR is decrypted
   - Hash is validated
   - Real-time status is displayed (Valid / Expired / Revoked)
